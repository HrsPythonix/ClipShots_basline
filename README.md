# DeepSBD for ClipShots
This repository contains our implementation of [deepSBD]() for [ClipShots]().

## Introduction
We implemente deepSBD in this repository. There are 2 backbones that can be selected, including the original Alexnet-like and ResNet-18 introduced in our [paper]().

## Resources
1. The [model]() for Alexnet-like backbone.
2. The [model]() for ResNet-18 backbone.
3. The pretrained [model]() for ResNet-18 backbone.

## Training
Please refer to `train.sh`

## Testing
Add '--no_train' options to `train.sh`.
